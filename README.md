Project Setup
Use this repo as a template for any python/database based projects.
Start up the project by creating a new Gitpod workspace. During that process the repo will automatically use docker to set up all the dependencies and set up a database for you with pgadmin enabled. Additionally all of the python modules should be installed as well.
Credentials for the pgadmin/database are in the docker-compose file.
Default database information is in the pgadmin_import.json file.
Copy & Paste the superheroes.sql file into PGAdmin to get the default setup.
Execute/run the connection.py file and if the connection prints "Connection to PostgreSQL DB successful" you're good to go.

Documentation, albeit pretty rough to look at, can be found for this here

PostgresQL
The https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/ tutorial and documentation is a very helpful resource to have throughout the project.
